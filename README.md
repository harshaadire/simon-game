The Simon game, invented in 1978, tests memory using four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow). Players repeat sequences of lights and sounds, which grow longer with each success. 
A mistake ends the game. Simon enhances memory and focus and remains popular in physical and digital versions. ðŸš€
